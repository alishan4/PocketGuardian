**PocketGuardian** is a multi-agent, AI-powered app that automatically analyzes your financial SMS messages to protect you from fraud and overspendingâ€”designed for mobile banking users in Pakistan.

## **The Problem**

Millions in Pakistan use mobile banking (Easypaisa, JazzCash, etc.), but:
- SMS transaction alerts are hard to understand.
- Scams are increasing, and users are vulnerable.
- No easy way to track weekly/monthly spending or stay within budget.

---

## **Our Solution**

**PocketGuardian** uses advanced AI agents to:
- **Parse any SMS** (e.g. "Rs.1500 debited for groceries" or "Congratulations! You won 50,000 rupees") and extract transaction details.
- **Detect fraud/scams** using a fine-tuned Hugging Face Transformer (not every message is fraud! Only suspicious ones are flagged).
- **Track weekly and monthly spending** for each user, updating in real time.
- **Alert users** if they're overspending (e.g. "You have spent 80% of your monthly budget") or if a message is likely a scam.
- **Remind users** about dangerous or costly behavior via push notifications.

## **How It Works **

   - Register with your phone, email, and set your weekly/monthly budget limits.

2. **Paste or Forward Any Financial SMS:**

3. **Results Are Displayed Instantly:**
   - **Transaction details** (amount, type, description)
   - **Fraud detection** (with risk level, keywords/patterns found)
   - **Spending analysis** (progress bars for weekly/monthly limits, overspending alerts)
